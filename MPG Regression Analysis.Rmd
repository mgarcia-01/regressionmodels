## Executive Summary:
Motor Trend contains a vast amount of data relating to the vehicles specifications. The research will
attempt to answer two questions relating to our question: MPG is better

“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"



```{r cars}
summary(mtcars)
names(mtcars)
hist
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
