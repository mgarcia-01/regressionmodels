## Exeutive Summary

Motor Trend provides information, opinions, and tips about cars to its readers. A topic of interest is energy efficiency of vehicles, specifically autmatic and manual transimission and miles per gallon. The analysis will provide insight into the methods used and the results for answering the question is miles per gallon for automatic vehicles greater than, less than, or equal to vehicles with manual transmission.
      * “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
      * "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"


## Exploratory Analysis



```{r cars}
data(cars)
summary(mtcars)
mtcarsdf <- as.data.frame(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plots, echo=TRUE}
cargrp <- aggregate(mtcars$am, list(mtcars$mpg), function(x) unique(x))
colnames(cargrp) <- c("mpg", "am")
cargrp[17,2]

```



## Linear Regression 
The simple linear regression model is not a valid model given a low coefficient of determination and the type of data points.
The outcome is based on probabilities of binary options.

```{r linearmodel, echo=TRUE}
lmCars <- lm(mtcars$am~ mtcars$mpg)
summary(lmCars)
```


##GLM

The model supports that the MPG increases for vehicles that are automatic.


```{r glm, echo=TRUE}
logCars <- glm(mtcars$am~ mtcars$mpg, family = "binomial")
summary(logCars)
logCars$fitted
```

## Probability Plot Automatic Transmission


```{r glmplot, echo=TRUE} 
plot(mtcars$mpg,logCars$fitted,pch=19,col="blue",xlab="MPG",ylab="Probability Automatic")

```


## Results
```{r sample, echo = TRUE}
poverty <- read.csv(paste0(getwd(),"/","poverty.csv"))
plm <- lm(poverty$PovPct~poverty$Brth15to17)
summary(plm)

```
